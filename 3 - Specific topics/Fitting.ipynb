    "Now we need to think of a model $f(x)$ to describe $y$. In general, we will use a family of parametrised models $f(x;\\mu)$, and find the best value for the parameters $\\mu$ (which can be a vector) that describes the observed $y_i$. A common strategy is to measure the discrepancy between the model and data in terms of a scalar function $L(\\mu)$, and find the $\\mu$ at which this discrepancy is minimised. A commonly used approach is to use the summed squares of the _residuals_ (the difference between the model and data at each data point), $$ L(\\mu) = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\big(y_i-f(x_i;\\mu)\\big)^2,$$ which is called _least squares_. For more information on when this is the appropriate function to minimise, see the reference notebook linked in the documentation section at the start of the notebook.\n",

    "A common choice for a model is a polynomial $f(x;\\mu)=a+bx+cx^2+...$, where the parameters are the polynomial coefficients $\\mu=(a,b,c...)$. In this case (as in any case where $f$ is linear in $\\mu$), this optimisation problem reduces to a set of linear equations, which can be solved by inverting a matrix (see the reference notebook for more information). This is called _linear least squares_. There are several convenient implementations of this in NumPy and SciPy. The following performs a fit to a degree-1 polynomial $f=a+bx$ using the `polyfit` function in NumPy. (To do a non-polynomial linear fit, see the reference notebook.)"

    "## Estimating errors\n",
    "Suppose we wanted to assess the accuracy of our best-fit parameters $\\mu_0$. The common approach is to see how the squared residuals change with the parameter. In general, the loss function is $$L(\\mu) = (\\mu-\\mu_0)^T C^{-1} (\\mu-\\mu_0)+\\rm constant,$$ where $C$ is called the _covariance matrix_. The diagonal elements of $C$ correspond to (squares of) our error estimates for each parameter. While the way it is presented here might make this seem arbitrary, it well-defined statistically; to understand it, see the reference notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a one-parameter example. The squared residuals are $$L(\\mu) = \\frac{(\\mu-\\mu_0)^2}{\\sigma^2}+...,$$ where $\\sigma$ is the error on our parameter: as $\\mu$ is changed from its best-fit value, the faster the errors increase, the more precise our fit is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The values of the errors (rather than ratios between them) only make sense if the errors in $y_i$ are on the scale of 1, but `numpy.polyfit` automatically scales $C$ to correct for that. To obtain the covariance matrix using `polyfit`, pass something into the keyword argument `cov`. We can pass our error estimates for $y$ by providing inversely proportional weights `w=1/y_err`. (If we didn't have estimates for the $y$ error, the algorithm would estimate it using the residuals and scale $C$ accordingly. We can turn off this auto-scaling of the covariance matrix by passing `cov=\"unscaled\"`."
