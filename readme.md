# Python tutorials
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/berkeley-physics/Python-Tutorials/master)

These are introductory materials that are designed for physics students with little to no prior programming experience. These notebooks are far from comprehensive, but they are designed to ease new learner's into the general flow of things. We prioritize the basics in order to get students to the point where they can branch out and seek additional material elsewhere.

## Workshop
Register [here](https://forms.gle/UjJn8r2vpT7h7G148) for the workshop to be held in the first few weeks of the Fall 2020 semester, where you will have the opportunity to work through these notebooks with suitable partner(s) under the guidance of instructors. Feel free to join the associated [piazza course](http://piazza.com/berkeley/fall2020/physics314159) even if you are not joining the workshop.

## Getting started
Click [here](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fberkeley-physics%2FPython-Tutorials&urlpath=tree%2FPython-Tutorials%2F1+-+Introductory%2F0+-+What+is+Python.ipynb&branch=master) to launch into the DataHub where the notebooks can be read and run interactively. Alternatively, if you don't have a Berkeley login, you can launch using the binder button above .
